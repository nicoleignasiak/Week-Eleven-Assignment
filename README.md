# Week-Eleven-Assignment
Week Eleven (already). Some bowling, some walking.

##Part I  

In this folder you have a text file called *testscores.txt*.  This is a list of rolls for a game and the tallied score as the last element.  Your task is to read in this file and calculate the correct score using the BowlingGame.py class.  Then, for each line in the file, print out the correct score and the given score and an indication as to whether or not the score is correct.  

##Part II

A random walk is a particular kind of probabilistic simulation that models certain statistical systems such as the Brownian motion of molecules. You can think of a one-dimensional random walk in terms of coin flipping. Suppose you are standing on a very long straight sidewalk that extends both in front of and behind you. You flip a coin. If it comes up heads, you take a step forward; tails means to take a step backward.
Suppose you take a random walk of n steps. On average, how many steps away from the starting point will you end up? Write a program to help you investigate this question.
